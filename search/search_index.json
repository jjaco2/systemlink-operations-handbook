Use LDAP attributes and groups to map users to roles and workspaces in SystemLink's role based access control system. Assumptions and Prerequisites \u00b6 A server running SystemLink. Refer to Installing and Configuring SystemLink Server and Clients for the basics of setting up a SystemLink server. Administrator desktop access to the SystemLink server. An LDAP server accessible to the SystemLink server. A bind user and bind password for the LDAP server. SystemLink supports anonymous connections. In this case the bind user and bind password are not needed. Familiarity with the LDAP attributes available to your organization. If you do not know what LDAP attributes and groups are available to you, talk with your LDAP system administrator. Tools such ADExplorer can be helpful to explore the attributes assigned to your users. Enabling LDAP in SystemLink \u00b6 Configuring Authentication \u00b6 Log into the server running SystemLink and open NI Web Sever Configuration . Go to the Authentication tab and enable Connect to an LDAP server . Enter the LDAP URL for your sever. Refer to LDAP URLs for details on how to structure this URL. Enter the bind user. Refer to Bind User for details on usernames that can be used here. Enter the bind password. Click Apply and Restart . Configuration needed to enable logging into a SystemLink server using LDAP credentials. You may now login to the SystemLink server using your LDAP credentials. To access systems and data in SystemLink, configure workspace and role mappings. Refer to Mapping LDAP Attributes and Groups to SystemLink Workspaces and Roles for details. View from a user who can login but does not have any workspace and role mappings. LDAP URL and Bind User \u00b6 You must provide a URL and bind user and bind password to establish an authenticated connection between your SystemLink server and LDAP server. LDAP URL \u00b6 The LDAP URL follows a standard scheme. URL Scheme <ldap>://<server-dns>:<port>/<target-entry-dn>?<username-attribute>?<scope>?<filter> protocol: ldap or ldaps for secure connections. SystemLink does not support STARTTLS, which allows connections over non-TLS and then initiate a TLS handshake. server-dns: The LDAP server SystemLink is connecting to. port: The port of the LDAP server. If your LDAP server is backed by Windows Active Directory, you may point to the global catalog on port 3268 to enable login from multiple domains (forest). target-entry-dn: The base search distinguished name (DN) for the LDAP directory user-name-attribute: The attribute that determines the SystemLink username for login. scope: The scope of the directory search. Scope defaults to sub but can be set to one to restrict users to the base DN. filter: The LDAP search filter. This defaults to objectClass=* to find find all objects in the directory. This allows you to restrict login to users who have a specific attribute. Basic LDAP URL Example Example: ldap://example.com:389/dc=example,dc=com?sAMAccountName In this example the server is example.com , the port is 389, the base search DN is dc=example,dc=com and the LDAP attribute used for user login is sAMAccountName . Example LDAP URLs specifying different usernames for the user Jane Doe URL: ldap://example.com/dc=example,dc=com?sAMAccountName Username: jdoe URL: ldap://example.com/dc=example,dc=com?userPrincipalName Username: jane.doe@example.com Username jdoe is used because the sAMAccountName attribute is specified in the LDAP URL. If a username attribute is not specified NI Web Server Configuration will automatically add uid as the attribute. Depending on your LDAP directory setup this attribute may not be available. Bind User \u00b6 The bind user and bind password are used to authenticate with the LDAP server. Provide a distinguishedName or a userPrincipalName to specify the bind user. If the password for this user changes, NI Web Server Configuration must be updated for users to continue to log into SystemLink. Bind user formats for the user Jane Doe distinguishedName: cn=jdoe,dc=example,dc=com userPrincipalName: jane.doe@example.com Mapping LDAP Groups, Users, and Attributes to Workspaces and Roles \u00b6 To add a user or collection of users to a workspace and assign a role you must complete the role mapping workflow. Log in to the SystemLink web application with a user mapped to the Server Administrator role. Go to Security > Workspaces and click the gear icon in the top right. Create a new workspace or edit an existing workspace. Go to the Role Mappings tab. Click +MAPPING and select one of the available LDAP mapping types: LDAP Group , LDAP User , or LDAP Attribute . If you have have selected LDAP Attribute enter a valid key and value. For LDAP User or LDAP Group enter a valid value. LDAP Group Mapping \u00b6 LDAP Group mapping queries the objectClass of group (Active Directory specific), groupOfName , and groupOfUniqueNames to matches either member or uniqueMember attributes of the group. LDAP User Mapping \u00b6 You may specify a LDAP username when creating workspace and role mappings. The username you specify is the same as the usernames for logging into SystemLink. LDAP Attribute Mapping \u00b6 You can use any available LDAP attribute to create a workspace and role mapping. In this case both the name and value of the attribute must match exactly for the mapping to be successful. example LDAP attribute mapping Mapping the country attribute c with the value US to the Data Maintainer Role in the Default workspace.","title":"Sign on with LDAP"},{"location":"ldap/ldap/#sign-on-with-ldap","text":"You can configure SystemLink to use the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for user authentication.

You can use OpenID Connect alongside or as a replacement for LDAP, Active Directory, and local Windows accounts for authentication. Assumptions and Prerequisites \u00b6 A server running SystemLink 2020R4 or greater. Refer to Installing and Configuring SystemLink Server and Clients for the basics of setting up a SystemLink server A DNS name for the SystemLink server SystemLink login with the Server Administrator role Administrator desktop access to the SystemLink server An OpenID Connect Provider server such as PingFederate , Azure ADFS , Okta , or another certified provider that has been fully setup and configured for OpenID Connect authentication Enabling OpenID Connect in SystemLink \u00b6 Log into the server running SystemLink and go to C:\\Program Files\\National Instruments\\Shared\\Web Server\\conf\\openidc . Add the configuration files to SystemLink to connect to your OpenID Connect provider. For details, refer to OpenID Connect Configuration Files in SystemLink Server . Open NI Web Server Configuration . Go to the Authentication tab and enable Use OpenID Connect (advanced) . Click Apply and restart . Login into the SystemLink web application with a user assigned the Server Administrator role. Go to Security > Roles and click the gear icon in the top right. Add an OpenID Connect Claim mapping for the Server Administrator role. For details, refer to Mapping OpenID Connect Claims to SystemLink Workspaces and Roles . Log out and log in as an OpenID Connect user with a mapping for the Server Administrator role and confirm they have the correct privileges. Enable OpenID Connect in NI Web Server OpenID Connect Configuration Files in SystemLink Server \u00b6 There are three files that you must create to connect your SystemLink server to an OpenID Connect provider: [provider-dns].conf , [provider-dns].client , and [provider-dns].provider . The [provider-dns] portion of each filename must be the URL-encoded fully qualified domain name. Refer to openid-connect-config for examples of each of these files. Example An OpenID Connect provider with the DNS example.com:9999 would yield files named example.com%3a9999.conf , example.com%3a9999.client , and example.com%3a9999.provider . These files do not exist for new SystemLink installations. Add each file to C:\\Program Files\\National Instruments\\Shared\\Web Server\\conf\\openidc . Restart the NI Web Server to apply changes. You can configure SystemLink to support multiple OpenID Connect providers simultaneously by creating a [provider-dns].conf , [provider-dns].client , and [provider-dns].provider file for each provider. The user ID in SystemLink must be unique across providers. This ID takes the form [sub_claim]@issuer . You can see the ID SystemLink associates with a user in the user details in SystemLink Security. SystemLink Login Configuration \u00b6 [provider-dns].conf describes the scopes SystemLink will request, the text and icon for the provider login button, and private keys for ID token key management encryption. { \"scope\" : \"openid email profile\" , \"ni-attributes\" : { \"displayName\" : \"Log in with PingFederate\" , \"iconUri\" : \"/login/assets/pf.png\" }, \"keys\" : [ { \"p\" : \"...\" , \"kty\" : \"RSA\" , \"q\" : \"...\" , \"d\" : \"...\" , \"e\" : \"AQAB\" , \"use\" : \"enc\" , \"kid\" : \"2020-11-20\" , \"qi\" : \"...\" , \"dp\" : \"...\" , \"dq\" : \"...\" , \"n\" : \"...\" } ] } In this example the openid , email , and profile scopes are requested. Additional scopes may be requested. Consult your provider's documentation regarding exposing scopes to clients. The profile and email scopes are required to populate first name, last name, and email fields in the SystemLink user preferences. These are derived from the given_name , family_name , and email claims respectively. Each scope contains claims you can map to roles within SystemLink workspaces. See Mapping OpenID Connect Claims to SystemLink Workspaces and Roles for details. The ni-attributes section determines the text and (optionally) an icon to be shown in the SystemLink login page. The iconUri is relative to htdocs directory ( C:\\Program Files\\National Instruments\\Shared\\Web Server\\htdocs ). This icon should be 16x16 px. SystemLink login windows with SSO login option. An icon has not been set in this example The keys section contains the private keys as a JWK Set if the provider uses asymmetric encryption for ID token key management. The corresponding public keys must be registered with the provider. The use property must have a value of enc to indicate the key is used for encryption. The kid property of the private key must match the kid property of the corresponding public key on the identity provider. The keys section can be omitted if the provider uses symmetric encryption or no encryption for ID token key management. ClientID and Secret \u00b6 The [provider-dns].client file is used by the NI Web Server to authenticate with the provider. { \"client_id\" : \"slserver\" , \"client_secret\" : \"4vFm89u07xaredactedredactedredactede2tjtsEGQhlLreLVjcyLA0\" } The client_id and client_secret can be obtained from the provider. Depending on the provider the client_id may be user defined. ClientID and Secret Provider Documentation \u00b6 PingFederate - Configuring an OAuth Client Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google APIs Okta - Find your Application's credentials ADFS - Build a server side application using OAuth confidential clients with AD FS 2016 or later OpenID Connect Configuration and Discovery \u00b6 The [provider-dns].provider file includes the contents of the provider's OpenID Connect configuration. This file tells SystemLink which endpoints the provider exposes that are used during login. You may use curl to create this file. Replace [provider-dns] with the DNS of your OpenID Connect Provider. curl https:// [ provider-dns ] /.well-known/openid-configuration -o [ provider-dns ] .provider Setting Login Redirect URI \u00b6 The client configuration for your provider requires a redirect URL that is used during the login flow. This must be the fully qualified domain name, the protocol ( https:// or http:// ), and the port (if 80 or 443 are not used) of the SystemLink server. If the SystemLink server's DNS changes, update this setting with your provider. Note NI recommends the DNS name in the redirect URI match the the preferred hostname set in NI Web Server Configuration on the SystemLink server. The SystemLink login redirect URL \u00b6 Use the following URL to configure your provider: [protocol]://[systemlink-dns]/login/openidc-redirect Provider Client Configuration Documentation \u00b6 PingFederate - Configure an OAuth client Google - Using OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications Okta - Understand the callback route Supported Signing and Encryption Algorithms \u00b6 SystemLink supports the following algorithms for ID token signing, ID token key management encryption, and ID token content encryption. ID Token Signing Algorithm \u00b6 None ECDSA Using P256 Curve and SHA-256 ECDSA Using P384 Curve and SHA-384 ECDSA Using P521 Curve and SHA-512 HMAC using SHA-256 HMAC using SHA-384 HMAC using SHA-512 RSA using SHA-256 RSA using SHA-384 RSA using SHA-512 RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 RSASSA-PSS using SHA-384 RSASSA-PSS using SHA-512 ID Token Key Management Encryption Algorithm \u00b6 Algorithms that do not require a private key: No encryption Direct Encryption with symmetric key AES-128 Key Wrap AES-192 Key Wrap AES-256 Key Wrap Algorithms that require a private key: RSAES OAEP ECDH-ES Refer to SystemLink Login Configuration for information on configuring the private key. ID Token Content Encryption Algorithm \u00b6 Composite AES-CBC-128 HMAC-SHA-256 Composite AES-CBC-192 HMAC-SHA-384 Composite AES-CBC-256 HMAC-SHA-512 Mapping OpenID Connect Claims to SystemLink Workspaces and Roles \u00b6 Map OpenID Connect claims to roles and workspaces so users can access systems and data managed by SystemLink. This process is the same as the mapping workflow for LDAP and Active Directory attributes. Refer to Assigning Users to Roles in a Workspace in the SystemLink manual. You can also use claims to create a mapping for the Server Administrator role. Viewing Claims Returned by a Provider \u00b6 The OpenID Connect provider determines which scopes and claims clients can access. To see available claims, use the userinfo_endpoint hosted by the provider. Use https://[provider-dns]/.well-known/openid-configuration to determine the URL of the userinfo_endpoint . You will need to obtain a valid bearer token to authenticate and access this endpoint. Example curl request to return user info. The bearer token has been truncated for readability. curl -s https://slsso-runtime.grl-us1.uat.k8s.com/idp/userinfo.openid -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiI...zJVy2oLnrBmXTmpDRm499U4~' | python -m json.tool You can also view claims returned by a particular user by modifying the httpd configuration on your SystemLink server. Go to C:\\Program Files\\National Instruments\\Shared\\Web Server\\conf\\defines.d\\ and open 50_mod_auth_openidc-defines.conf in a text editor. Change the configuration UnDefine AUTH_OIDC_ENABLE_CLAIM_INFO to Define AUTH_OIDC_ENABLE_CLAIM_INFO . Restart NI Web Server. Go to [protocol]://[systemlink-dns]/login/openidc-redirect?info=html or [protocol]://[systemlink-dns]/login/openidc-redirect?info=json to view user claims. An example 50_mod_auth_openidc-defines.conf modified to expose user claims. You must be logged via OpenID Connect to receive data this endpoint. # # Defined OpenID-Connect configuration for the Windows Apache installation. # # The name of the JSON map containing metadata about each identity provider. Define AUTH_OIDC_ATTRIBUTES_KEY ni-attributes # CA bundle to use when making requests to an identity provider. Define AUTH_OIDC_BUNDLE ../nicurl/ca-bundle.crt # Path to OIDC provider configuration. Define AUTH_OIDC_PROVIDER_DIR ${HTCONF_PATH}/openidc # The location to redirect when performing an OpenID-Connect login. Define AUTH_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI /login/openidc-redirect # # User-editable variables. # # Whether OIDC is enabled. Define AUTH_OIDC_ENABLED # When enabled, /login/openidc-redirect?info=json and # /login/openidc-redirect?info=html will return the claims for the currently # logged in user. Define AUTH_OIDC_ENABLE_CLAIM_INFO If the provider is https with a certificate signed by a CA not included in the NI-CURL CA bundle ( C:\\Program Files\\National Instruments\\Shared\\nicurl\\ca-bundle.crt ), then the AUTH_OIDC_PROVIDER_DIR define in 50_mod_auth_openidc-defines.conf must to be updated to point to a CA bundle containing the provider's CA. The path can be absolute, or relative to C:\\Program Files\\National Instruments\\Shared\\Web Server . Mapping Claims to SystemLink Roles \u00b6 Claims are returned as a JSON object. Example response from userinfo_endpoint . Use any of these claims to a map a user to a role in a workspace. { \"email\" : \"jane.doe@ni.com\" , \"family_name\" : \"Doe\" , \"given_name\" : \"Jane\" , \"name\" : \"Jane Doe\" , \"ni_employee\" : \"2670\" , \"sub\" : \"jdoe\" } Within the security UI the claim and its returned value can be mapped to a role within a Workspace. Mapping the ni_employee claim to a workspace. If the claim value is a scalar, then it must exactly match the value specified in the role mapping. If the claim value is an array, then one of the array elements must exactly match the value specified in the role mappings. If the claim value contains quotes the quotes must be escaped with \\. Example claim containing quotes { \"userinfo\" : { \"sub\" : \"88442211\" , \"country\" : \"US\" , \"name\" : \"Bob Smith\" , \"http://www.example.come/roles\" : [ \"user\" , \"a\\\"b\" ] } } Claims must be escaped with the \\ character. Refreshing user claims \u00b6 Claims are fetched at login. Log out and log back in for updated claims to affect role mappings. Troubleshooting Failed Authentication \u00b6 The following sources can be used to troubleshoot a failed connection. OpenID Connect Provider logs: Consult your OpenID Connect Provider's documentation on the location of their application log files. NI Web Server Logs: These are found at C:\\ProgramData\\National Instruments\\Web Server\\logs\\error.log . Note SystemLink uses log rotation therefore the latest logs may be in one of the numbered error.log files. Returned Claims: See Viewing Claims Returned by a Provider . Cache Entry Size \u00b6 The OpenID Connect module stores information in a shared memory cache. If a cache entry is too large, users will see an \"Internal Server Error\" when attempting to log in. This typically occurs when you are returning a large number of claims or claims with large values. Example error logs When this happens, the NI Web Server error logs will contain entries like the following: oidc_cache_shm_set: could not store value since value size is too large oidc_cache_set: could NOT store X bytes in shm cache backend for key Y To resolve this issue: Open the following file in a text editor run as Administrator: C:\\Program Files\\National Instruments\\Shared\\Web Server\\conf\\defines.d\\50_mod_auth_openidc-defines.conf Find the line starting with Define AUTH_OIDC_CACHE_ENTRY_SIZE . Modify the number at the end to a number larger than X, where X is the required size of the cache entry specified in the error log. Restart the NI Web Server from the Control tab of the NI Web Server Configuration application. ID Token Management Encryption \u00b6 The following situations can lead to an error and redirect the user back to the SystemLink login page after authenticating with the OpenID Connect provider: The provider is using an asymmetric ID token management encryption algorithm and private keys are missing or incorrect The provider is using an unsupported ID token management encryption algorithm Example error logs The error will be reported in the NI Web Server error logs: oidc_proto_parse_idtoken: oidc_jwt_parse failed The log entry will also contain more information about the problem. To resolve this issue: Confirm that the provider is using supported encryption and signing algorithms. See Supported Signing and Encryption Algorithms . Consult your provider's documentation for information on setting the encryption and signing algorithms. If the provider is using asymmetric ID token management encryption, confirm that the private key is configured in [provider-dns] .conf and the corresponding public key is configured in the provider. Refer to SystemLink Login Configuration for information on configuring the private key. Consult your provider's documentation for information on configuring the ID token management encryption algorithm and public key.","title":"Single Sign-on with OpenID Connect"},{"location":"openid-connect/openid-connect/#single-sign-on-with-openid-connect","text":"You can configure SystemLink to use OpenID Connect to authorize users.
